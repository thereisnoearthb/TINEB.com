            Appeal to stop the commercialization of Sanjay Van
          </u>
        </p>
        <p>
          This email is in reference to citizens’ appeal to withdraw the Tender Notification issued by Delhi Development
          Authority to convert the Sanjay Vann area into an Eco-Tourism Hub. Delhi Development Authority (hereinafter
          referred to as “DDA”) is planning to utilize the forest area for recreational purposes such as rock climbing,
          paragliding, aerial trails (canopy tours, ziplines, valley crossing, Burma bridge crossing), forest safari,
          leisure cycling, camping, and picnic spots,
          star gazing, bird watching, guided nature tours, and flora and fauna observation trips among other activities.
          <b>Further, the construction activities of the forest as directed by LG to officials, is detrimental to the
            lush forest. Green patches inside the forest are to be identified and the respective space will be developed 
            for organizing small national and international conferences, festivals, cultural events, and other recreational 
            activities. </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The authorities are also planning to expand public amenities inside the forest through extensive construction 
            of restaurants, toilets, drinking water, etc.., for the convenience of the visitors. It must be noted that 
            Sanjay Van is one of the few untouched green lungs of the Capital but is on the verge of massive destruction 
            as the LG’s orders of fruit-bearing trees’ plantation and cocoon rearing in Sanjay Van for awareness of silk 
            production is nothing more than playing with nature according to one’s own needs and desires. The plantation of 
            fruit-bearing trees not native to Delhi’s biodiversity might not survive. The authority is merely trying to change 
            the face of the forest and disturb the natural ecology of Sanjay Van. The recreational activities and plantations 
            are mere attractions and key to the commercialization of Sanjay Van.</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>
          We most humbly urge the LG Delhi to recall the orders for the construction of restaurants, conference rooms etc., because adventure sports and Eco-tourism are not possible without deforestation, disturbing biodiversity and wildlife in Sanjay Van. Moreover, according to the latest study, Delhi is the most polluted city in the world. The only access to clean air will be hampered immensely if this project moves ahead.
        </b></p>
        <p>
          The forest is home to several avifauna species and diverse varieties of trees. Because of the same, Sanjay
          Vann
          is frequented by a lot of birdwatchers and also cyclists who come here to ride in and breathe fresh air in the
          morning. Aside from birds that include Eurasian golden oriole, purple sunbird, Asian koel, Brahminy starling,
          Indian silverbill, white-throated kingfisher, Grey-breasted Prinia, crested honey buzzard, rufous treepie, and
          Indian paradise flycatcher, etc, the forest also conserves habitat for jackals, snakes, nilgais and several
          species of butterflies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanjay Vann has already undergone severe degradation in recent times with the proliferation of the
          <u><em>Prosopis juliflora</em></u>, commonly known as vilayati kikar tree, which is non-endemic to the 
          <u><em>Aravalli Ranges</em></u> and has caused depletion
          of
          the groundwater level, killing native flora and changing the natural soil characteristics of the Aravallis.
          Sewage water and effluent which is discharged into Sanjay Van has also affected this green belt in the
          Capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the recent case of <b>Jaipal Singh v. Lt. Governor</b>, the NGT observed that no non-forest activity is permissible 
          in the Ridge area. The tribunal had also placed reliance on the case of <b>DDA v. Kenneth Builders & Developers (P) Ltd.</b>
          wherein it was held that <i>“the project of DDA involving non forestry use of the land could be permitted only 
          after obtaining clearance from the Ridge Management Board and after obtaining the permission of this Court.”</i>
          Additionally, the tribunal observed that <i>“the Ridge in Delhi has historical and environmental significance.
          It is made of quartzite rocks. It has special and distinct features and uses.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, the recent proposal of DDA to convert Sanjay Vann into an Eco-Tourism hub will deteriorate the only
          left
          green belts of Delhi. Cutting down trees for the construction of restaurants, toilets etc, in the name of the convenience of visitors would disturb the biodiversity of the forest. The National Capital has already made international headlines for its poor air quality
          every year. Experts have already warned that
        <blockquote>
          <em>
            “Forest areas should be left untouched, as we don't have a lot of genuine forest area left in the capital
            city. Nature trails are already there in Sanjay Vann and anything beyond that would be an invasion of forest
            land.”
          </em>
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, as a citizen, I urge you to help restore one the only remaining green patches of the city and prevent
          the
          damage from happening.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Direct the Delhi Development Authority to recall the Tender Notice issued for Eco-Tourism at Sanjay Van.
          </li>
          <li>
            Direct South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to do proper clean-up of Sanjay Van.
          </li>
          <li>
            Direct SDMC to take strict action against the spilling of garbage, plastic waste at Sanjay Vann.
          </li>
          <li>
            Direct SDMC to conduct regular awareness campaigns on sustainability, the climate crisis, and the importance
            of Sanjay Van for the national capital.
          </li>
          <li>
            Install new waste bins by replacing the old and damaged ones.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Eagerly anticipating an immediate, careful, and most urgent consideration of the above matter from your end.
